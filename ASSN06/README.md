# DH110-Spring23: Assignment 6

**Project Description:** This current project seeks to simplify the process of content sharing between close friends, family, and associates of different generations. The goal of this project is to create a link and media sharing platform for close friends, family, and associates, cultivating connection by sharing the music, movies, and media you consume within a recent time period. In its design, the aim is to create a simplistic platform to share the media that interests you without the pressure to cater to a larger audience.

**Process:** I began by creating a layout for the wireframe based on the [wireflow](https://www.figma.com/file/Yogf1YyDLIqEYcf9dMgQ6R/ASSN05?type=design&t=2ijkWNiQniYDZLOQ-1) I had created for the previous assignment. I chose 2 columns and 5 rows, with fairly large margins for navigational buttons. I then chose 3 color scheme variations, 3 shape variations, and ended with 3 typographic variations. Throughout the variations, I adjusted the stroke and size of the buttons, the button graphics, and the sizes of the margins for the layout. See the [full screen design screens here](https://www.figma.com/file/6tEi4QGwIznQT5CKe7BiSr/ASSN06?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=zMPu2aZdeFq2XZok-1).

# **Impression Test**

**Final Design Details:**

I wanted a simple wireframe to try and connect to the different generations & levels of technical expertise that users may be coming from. For the profile page, I wanted a large, visible button that would notify users where to upload their links/media. I knew a visible help and settings button in opposing corners would be simple and indicate their use. I know that I wanted to appeal to some option of customability for the profile, so I implemented a large profile picture for the user to view. Lastly, I added three navigational buttons: friends, add friends, and notifications. The "friends" button takes you to others' profiles, "add friends" is just as it seems: it allows you to add friends to be visible on the "friends" page which shows you others' profiles, and the notifications button allows you to be notified when someone tags you in their post.

**Wireframe Changes:** I made sure to remove the profile button from the profile page, per the suggestion of the participant in the wireflow testing, and I also added titles to the navigational buttons as the participant was confused on what each button reflected.
