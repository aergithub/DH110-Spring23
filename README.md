## Robert's Scenario

Robert is a father of 4 adult children and the grandfather of 7 children, the oldest of whom are now 14 and 16, looking into colleges and trade schools for after high school. It’s challenging for Robert to get his grandchildren on the phone to have a conversation and discuss their future, but Robert stills wants to be involved in the period of transformation following high school his grandchildren will go through, and most importantly, wants to ensure his grandchildren are making informed decisions about their future. 

Robert wants to share a recent article he read about the increased likelihood of being employed with a livable wage when a student graduates college from a four-year university. He navigates to the app, whose landing page showcases his profile picture and an edit button, an “upload” button, a “friends” button, messaging center, and notification center at the bottom to indicate different landing pages, as well as a profile symbol in the top left corner and a help symbol in the top right corner. He then clicks on the “upload” button, in which a “paste link” pop-up shows up, with an area to submit the link of his article, an area that says “add comment,” and a “cancel” and “upload” button at the bottom of the pop-up. Because he wants to get the attention of his grandkids, he clicks “add comment,” which populates a larger area that indicates “200 characters or fewer. Tag friends using the ‘@’.” Using the @ sign and his grandchildren’s name, he tags them, and presses upload.
