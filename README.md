# DH110-Spring23: Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry

**Project Design Challenge**

The goal of this project is to create a link and media sharing platform for close friends, family, and associates, cultivating connection by sharing the music, movies, and media you consume within a recent time period. As of now, various social media and messaging platforms allow for the facilitation of media sharing, but none that specifically target what you consume, or that center around a small, select network of close individuals to view your shared media. The goal is to create a simplistic platform to share the media that interests you without the pressure to cater to a larger audience. 

**Target Users**

The demographics I aim to target are teenagers, middle-aged adults, and older adults, all of whom are relatively experienced with social media platforms but not necessarily an expert. No particular type of expertise is required to interact with the platform.

**Research Methods**

In order to gain a better understanding of what features and platforms were attractive for users and why in regards to media sharing, I conducted a contextual inquiry interview. The session was conducted in person and the audio file was recorded through Zoom. The interview was composed of 4 sections: background questions, activities to observe the participantsâ€™ behaviors in sharing media with current platforms available to them, post-activity questions, and a wrap-up question to get a sense of how the participant might imagine a similar platform to the one I hope to create. The participant utilized their own personal cell phone to carry out the activities.

**Insights from the Interview**

The participant referenced two different platforms in sharing three different types of media: an article, a song, and a TV show. The aesthetics and features of the platform available to them when sharing the media played a large role in why they chose each platform, as well as the reach of each platform- some media the participant hoped to reach many individuals, some the participant hoped would only circulate within the curated community on the platform. Unfortunately, I did skip over a section of my interview that concerned any problems they had faced in sharing their media on certain platforms, so I would refer back to that in my next interview to get any understanding. However, I did ask a question that encompassed a portion of what I was hoping to review in the section, as in, what platforms have they decided not to share media with and why. Something of note was that they hoped to share their media with those with common interests within their generation, but that their media consumption was largely influenced by their family of different generations, and that they did share media with their family regularly.
