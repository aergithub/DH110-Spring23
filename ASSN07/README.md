# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype

**Project Description:** This current project seeks to simplify the process of content sharing between close friends, family, and associates of different generations. The goal of this project is to create a link and media sharing platform for close friends, family, and associates, cultivating connection by sharing the music, movies, and media you consume within a recent time period. In its design, the aim is to create a simplistic platform to share the media that interests you without the pressure to cater to a larger audience.

**Purpose and process of interactive prototype phase:** The purpose of this prototype is to visualize the user navigational process through a series of two tasks. I first created the design based on the previous assignment to polish the interface design system, and added small updates based on the feedback I received from both the user participant and the professor when they reviewed the design system. I then create a wireflow based on my low fidelity prototype, which had used usage scenarios to illustrate how a user might interact with the application.

**This prototype supports the following tasks:** 

Uploading a new media file to your profile, including adding a caption and tagging a “friend” on the post. 

Searching for a “friend,” Avery Jonson, by navigating to the “friends” page and searching for their name.

*Note: Although I delienate two wireflows, they are underneath the same interactive wireflow for Figma. I thought this might better illustrate the use of the application. I also did not add a pop-up notification that notifies the user that the media file is uploaded.*
