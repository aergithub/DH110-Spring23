# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype

**Project Description:** This current project seeks to simplify the process of content sharing between close friends, family, and associates of different generations. The goal of this project is to create a link and media sharing platform for close friends, family, and associates, cultivating connection by sharing the music, movies, and media you consume within a recent time period. In its design, the aim is to create a simplistic platform to share the media that interests you without the pressure to cater to a larger audience. 

Target users value the option for customization, a simple interface to interact with, and the ability to share their media with individuals with common interests, like peers or family members. User personas were created based on the prompt of the project to encompass individuals from different generations, one of which was an older lawyer who wanted to share media with his children and grandchildren and the other of which was a college student who didn't have the time to connect with her friends consistently but still hoped to keep up with the content they consumed. Based on these user personas, two tools were integrated into the mobile app: an upload feature with tagging to upload content to your profile for a select individual to review, and the second of which is a search bar to search your friend's profile to see their latest shared content. 

This low fidelity prototype was to test the functionality of the features and how intuitive the features were to use. 

**Tasks**

1. Upload content to your profile and tag a friend
2. Search a friend's profile to see recently shared content

**Wireframes and Wireflow**

**User Testing**

To begin my user testing, I provided the scenarios created in the previous assignment as context for what each wireframe was illustrating. I had a participant navigate through the wireframes without an indication of wireflow to ensure that each wireframe provided the necessary features to complete the scenario I introduced. See pictures of the participant going through the wireflow [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mwwzbqB2w1nA0liBAx1WAzPnsu-xYDnf/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GZ6edy6PfYUfvkKk2cp70aJnr7IwARYY/view?usp=sharing).

**User Insight** 

From the project description, the participant thought that the user could upload photos. This may be an addition for future prototypes to provide advanced features for more experienced users. Additionally, the participant was confused on which button indicated the "friends" page, so moving forward there will be captions for buttons. The participant also remarked there was no real need for a profile button while the page was populated on the user profile. The last comment the participant made was that they were confused on how profiles appeared, so moving forward there will need to be an explicit method of organizing profiles on the "friends" page. Overall, however, the participant indiciated that the wireframes illustrated the wireflow well.
