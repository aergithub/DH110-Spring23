### Introduction
This project seeks to simplify the process of content sharing between close friends, family, and associates of different generations. The goal of this project is to create a link and media sharing platform for close friends, family, and associates, cultivating connection by sharing the music, movies, and media you consume within a recent time period. In its design, the aim is to create a simplistic platform to share the media that interests you without the pressure to cater to a larger audience.

### Design Statement
Since its inception, the project was designed to simplify the process of media sharing, catering to a wider audience of users by centering its functionality around one main component: link sharing. Consider it a social media application that 

### Competitor Analysis
To analyze competing platforms, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of two websites designed for information storing and sharing. I also conducted a usability test of the application GetPocket.com, to assess the difficulty, or lack thereof, in utilizing the website’s features. I had the participant go through the process of engaging of each feature I found that stood out during the heuristics evaluation. The first was the “favorite” feature, unavailable from the discover page, preventing user control and freedom. The second was the “tagging” feature and referring back to those categories, of which you cannot view from the saves page, preventing visibility of system status. The last was the “recommendation” feature, which offered no insight as to where the recommendation went, and therefore there was no match to the real world.

### User Research
The demographics I aim to target are teenagers, middle-aged adults, and older adults, all of whom are relatively experienced with social media platforms but not necessarily an expert. No particular type of expertise is required to interact with the platform. In order to gain a better understanding of what features and platforms were attractive for users and why in regards to media sharing, I conducted a contextual inquiry interview. The session was conducted in person and the audio file was recorded through Zoom. The interview was composed of 4 sections: background questions, activities to observe the participants’ behaviors in sharing media with current platforms available to them, post-activity questions, and a wrap-up question to get a sense of how the participant might imagine a similar platform to the one I hope to create. The participant utilized their own personal cell phone to carry out the activities.

Conclusions of the contextual inquiry were that the aesthetics and features of the platform available to them when sharing the media played a large role in why they chose each platform. This was in addition to the reach of each platform- some media the participant hoped to reach many individuals, some the participant hoped would only circulate within the curated community on the platform. Something of note was that they hoped to share their media with those with common interests within their generation, but that their media consumption was largely influenced by their family of different generations, and that they did share media with their family regularly. See the contextual inquiry documentation [here.](https://github.com/aergithub/DH110-Spring23/blob/d4e9c5cf48cb6f222d6ead61ac93a6f7a7e0fafc/README.md) 

### UX Storytelling
I conducted user storytelling, with the purpose of designing from the user's perspective, creating functionality that centers the desires and needs of the intended audience. The two personas I created are Robert, a 68-year old criminal defense attorney who hopes to maintain a connection with his grandchildren, and Brooklyn, a 21-year old journalism student hoping to keep updated with family and friends. See the persona and user storytelling documentation [here.](https://github.com/aergithub/DH110-Spring23/blob/d47a00de57cdbe2a41595abfdff86f7626c67d0f/README.md) 

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation
Based on these scenarios, I mapped a [wireflow](https://www.figma.com/file/Yogf1YyDLIqEYcf9dMgQ6R/ASSN05?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=OY7XvxpH5STNHAah-1) on Figma taking the participant through the course of actions outlined in each persona's journey map. I then explored [design element variations](https://www.figma.com/file/6tEi4QGwIznQT5CKe7BiSr/ASSN06?type=design&t=OY7XvxpH5STNHAah-1) of color, symbol shape, and font to determine a finalied design for the application.

### Low-fidelity Prototype
The low-fidelity prototype was created to test the functionality of the application's features and to determine how intuitive the features were to use. Target users value the option for customization, a simple interface to interact with, and the ability to share their media with individuals with common interests, like peers or family members. Based on these user personas, two tools were integrated into the mobile app: an upload feature with tagging to upload content to your profile for a select individual to review, and the second of which is a search bar to search your friend's profile to see their latest shared content.

### High-fidelity Prototype 
The purpose of this prototype is to visualize the user navigational process through a series of two tasks. I first created the design based on the previous assignment to polish the interface design system, and added small updates based on the feedback I received from both the user participant and the professor when they reviewed the design system. I then create a wireflow based on my low fidelity prototype, which had used usage scenarios to illustrate how a user might interact with the application.

**The prototype supports the following tasks:** 

Uploading a new media file to your profile, including adding a caption and tagging a “friend” on the post.

Searching for a “friend,” Avery Jonson, by navigating to the “friends” page and searching for their name.

### Evaluation & Revision History
**Cognitive Walkthrough:** We conducted a cognitive walkthrough in-class to test the high fidelity prototype of the application. Unforetunately, I did not properly utilize platform features within Figma and my prototype failed from the aspect of its backflow. That being said, the perceived purpose of the app by the reviewers stood true to its actual purpose, ie, to share media, news sources, and magazine articles. The screens and interaction points were defined as "clear," and the only commentary outside of the failed interactions were that the profile should be in the menu. See **Revision History** for an update on that front. 

**Impression Test:** I conducted an impression test with a participant who was not entirely familiar with the purpose of the app (I should have summarized the project description before the test). The three biggest things that stood out to me was creating a more square-like shape for the media sharing icons, changing the "upload" button to "upload media," and adding an "edit profile" button that's closely associated with the profile picture. See the impression test video [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNkfmaz1cxZhfW3yuXeJILvqGMzKLgpx/view?usp=sharing)

*Note: I moved forward with creating a more square-like shape for the media sharing icons, but kept the "upload" button rather than "upload media" as well as the setting buttons in the top left-hand corner. Unlike more complex social media applications, there is little to customize for the "profile," beyond the picture and name, therefore all settings for the application fall underneath the settings tab and I do not think it necessary to associate it with the profile picture.*

**Accessibility Audit:** I had initially conducted a [color contrast test](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DNDnxLfXpPPsnveFG_WpJacn610cPEbG?usp=sharing) with the three color scheme variations in the graphic design element process. Upon review, each element was not fully reviewed to pass the color contrast test, so I've conducted another where you can find the results here **Link!!**

**Revision History: High Fidelity Prototype #2**

Find the second draft of the interactive prototype [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/l8EXhOCyP5XMSyUqb6mJMc/Prototype-%232?type=design&t=zOkhkOIQkPZ1EDMq-6) Note that I added a profile button on the navigation menu, better integrated Figma prototype features so that the wireflow and backflow all functioned well, and better integrated variants to create a more dynamic prototype. 

I conducted a usability test on the second high-fidelity prototype to assess the ease, or lack thereof, in navigating the application and utilizing the application's features. I utilized the earlier script from the usability test on GetPocket.com and made revisions in accordance to the features and tasks of the application. You can find the script I utilized [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuvy89tlUjCWO07aEQooQUfNNabEeQNPUQgLrct9XS3dsLXg/viewform?usp=sharing), the notes from the test here, although I note that the five descriptors of the application chosen in the usability test (calm, creative, familiar, old, and professional) as well as a reference to the "simplicity" of the application stood out most to me.
