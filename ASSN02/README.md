# Assignment #2: Usability Test

**Introduction:** This usability test was conducted on the usability of the web page [GetPocket.com](https://getpocket.com/home?src=navbar), a social bookmarking service for storing, sharing, and discovering web bookmarks. The purpose of this usability test is to assess the difficulty, or lack thereof, in utilizing the website’s features. I had the participant go through the process of engaging of each feature I found that stood out during the heuristics evaluation. The first was the “favorite” feature, unavailable from the discover page, preventing user control and freedom. The second was the “tagging” feature and referring back to those categories, of which you cannot view from the saves page, preventing visibility of system status. The last was the “recommendation” feature, which offered no insight as to where the recommendation went, and therefore there was no match to the real world.

**Conclusion:** The biggest thing I learned is that I truly need to practice the test several times before conducting- that way I can be fully attentive to the task at hand, as well as reassuring the participant and encouraging them to voice their thoughts during the test. I also believe I could have been better with the initial steps in tasks #2 and #3 as both were redundant; the participant began on the page I asked them to navigate to because of their navigation through the website. Additionally, I should be more specific on whether or not they’re answering the question of whether or not they’d do the task if they already used the website or if they were being introduced to the website.
